## **Crossfilter Demo**

This is just a visualization demo of time series data using
[Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) and
[dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/).  You can view the demo
on GitHub Pages
[here](https://jtainslie.github.io/crossfilter-demo/).

I built a version of this originally for work but rewrote this
version to allow users to load their own datasets using CSV files.
The initial data in the demo is available
[here](http://transmission.bpa.gov/Business/Operations/Wind/default.aspx)
and represents 9 years of hourly aggregates.
