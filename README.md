## **Crossfilter Demo**

This is just a visualization demo of time series data using
[Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/),
[dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/), and
[plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/).  You can view the demo
on GitHub Pages here:

[https://jtainslie.github.io/crossfilter-demo/](https://jtainslie.github.io/crossfilter-demo/).

I built a version of this originally for work but rewrote this
version to allow users to load their own datasets using CSV files.
The initial data in the demo is available from
[this source](http://transmission.bpa.gov/Business/Operations/Wind/default.aspx)
and represents 9 years of hourly aggregates.
